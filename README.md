# 🌐 NetKit

> [!CAUTION]
> This project started as a small guide to learn subnetting and basic networking concepts.
My goal was to create something useful and accessible, but over time I realized that I don’t feel confident enough to explain these topics to others (and that’s something I don’t feel good about). Because of that, I left it quite incomplete, and I don’t recommend using it as a serious resource to learn networking. However, I’m publishing the source code so that anyone can see how the project was built. Apologies to anyone who got interested and expected more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To build this project, I used material and examples from four public repositories (listed below).
You'll still find many of my own notes scattered throughout the content, but a large part of it comes directly from those sources (especially things I intended to complement but never finished due to abandoning the project).

**NetKit** is a general guide designed to help you discover some networking concepts, especially focused on small-scale network configuration.

## What is NetKit?

NetKit is an educational resource that gathers explanations, examples, and interactive tools to help you learn about:

- IP addressing and subnetting
- Subnet masks and CIDR calculations
- Network devices like switches and routers
- Routing tables and how they work
- Practice exercises and quizzes

## Main Features

- **Step-by-step guide** on some networking concepts.
- **Interactive calculator** for subnets and IP addresses.
- **Practice exercises and quizzes** to reinforce learning.
- **Simple explanations** and analogies to understand the real functioning of devices and protocols.
- **MIT License:** You can freely use, modify, and share the content.
