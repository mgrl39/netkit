TCP stands for **Transmission Control Protocol**. It is one of the main communication protocols used to send data over a network, including the internet. TCP enabled applications and devices to exchange messages reliably and establishing a connection between a source and a destination before sending data.

TCP's main role is to ensure that all data sent arrives **complete and in the correct order**. To do this, it breaks large amounts of data into smaller pieces called **packets**, ssend them over the network, and then reassembles them on the receiving side. It also detects if any packet is lost or corrupted and requests retransmission, guaranteeing the integrity of the data.
