TCP stands for **Transmission Control Protocol**. It is a communications standard that enables application programs and devices to exchange messages over a network. It is used to send packets across the internet.

TCP guarantees the integrity of the data being communicated over the network. Before it transmits data, TCP establishes a connection between a source and its destination, which remains active until communication begins. It then breaks largeamounts of data into smaller packets, while ensring end-to-end delivery without loss of any data.
