IP is part of an internet protocol suite, which also includes the Transmission Control Protocol. Together, these two are known as TCP/IP. The internet protocol suite governs rules for packetizing, addressing, transmitting, roouting, and receiving data over networks.

IP addressing is a logical means of assigning addresses to devices on a network. Each device connected to the internet requires a uniqque IP address.

An IP adddress has two parts: one part idenntifies the host such as a computer or other device,, and the other art identifeis the network it belongs to. TCP/IP uses a subnet mask to separate them.

## IPv4 vs IPv6
IP addresses come in 2 versions, Ipv4 and IPv6.

IPv4 example: 127.255.255.255
IPv6 example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:032e:0370:7334

Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number.
However, because of the growth of the internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998. 

## Public Address vs Private Address

A public IP address is an IP address that caan be accessed directly over the internet and is assigned to your neetwork router by your internet service provider (ISP).
A public (or external) IP adddress helps you connect to the internet from inside your network, to outside your network.

A private IP address is an address your network router assigns to your device. Each device within the same network is assigned a unique private IP address (sometimes called a private network address). This is how device on the same intenal network talk to each otherr.

When a network is connecteed to the internet, it cannot use an IP address from the reserved private IP addresses. The following ranges are reserved for privaate IP addresses:

```bash
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (65,536 IP addresses)
172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255  (1,048,576 IP addresses)
10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255  (16,777,216 IP addresses)
```
